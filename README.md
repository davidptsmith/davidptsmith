I have an architecturally trained background and experience in software development and data science, with a focus on leveraging innovation to solve complex industry problem.


I love what I do and I am always happy to chat.

Feel free to reach out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-pt-smith/)



## About Me: 

David Smith, generic name, interesting guy...  

I am a passionate technology professional with an architectural and computational design background, software development experience, and a Master of Data Science from UWA. 

My goal is to surround myself with interesting and driven people who are aligned in making a meaningful impact. 

I have proven experience leveraging this unique mindset and set of skills to solve complex problems, innovate, and bridge gaps between industry silos to generate value for various companies locally and nationally. I have worked in public art, architecture, urban design, education and training, VR & architectural visualisation, fabrication, software development, data science, and applied research. 

I am always up for a chat so if you would like to nerd out on any topic please get in touch.
