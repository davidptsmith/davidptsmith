## Hi, My Name is David! ðŸ‘‹

I have an architecturally trained background and experience in software development and data science, with a focus on leveraging innovation to solve complex industry problem.


I love what I do and I am always happy to chat.

Feel free to reach out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-pt-smith/)



## About Me: 

David Smith, generic name, interesting guy...  

An industry leader in the field of architecture, working as a software developer and design technologist leveraging computation to create efficiencies in the way we design, construct, and manage the built environment. 

Forever curious and learning, with a passion for all things technology and a focus on creating value with the goal of leading others to change the status quo of industries. A disrupter that leverages creativity and critical thinking through applied research to ensure the implementation of the right solution for the problem.

The transition from an architectural and computational design background to software development and data science, has enabled a unique mindset and set of skills to solve complex problems and bridge gaps between industry silos. Working collaboratively with stakeholders from multiple disciplines to achieve their goals, reduce barriers of entry in the uptake of new technology, and leverage data to drive decision making across public art, architecture, urban design, fabrication, construction, and education.

Passionate about all things technology and innovation - when not chatting about architecture, technology or data, I'll be at the beach or enjoying a nice cocktail â€“ a passion from days past as a cocktail bartender.

## Education: 

- M.DSc at University of Western Australia, 2022 *expected completion*
- M.Arch at University of Western Australia, 2019
